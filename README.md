# Incorrect use of $in operator with an array of ObjectId in MongoDB aggregation
This bug demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$in` operator with an array of ObjectIds in a MongoDB aggregation query.
The `$in` operator is used to check if a field's value exists in a given array.  However, when working with ObjectIds, it's crucial to ensure that the ObjectIds in the array are of the correct type.

## Bug
The following code snippet demonstrates the bug:
```javascript
db.collection.find({ _id: { $in: ["651a2f23430a", "651a2f25430b"] }})
```
This code attempts to find documents where the `_id` field is in the specified array. However, the array contains strings representing ObjectIds, not actual ObjectId objects. This will result in no documents being returned even if documents with those ObjectIds exist.

## Solution
The correct way to use the `$in` operator with ObjectIds is to explicitly cast the strings to ObjectId objects using the `ObjectId()` constructor.
```javascript
const objectIds = [ObjectId("651a2f23430a"), ObjectId("651a2f25430b")]
db.collection.find({ _id: { $in: objectIds }})
```
This solution ensures that the `$in` operator is comparing against actual ObjectId objects, leading to correct query results.
